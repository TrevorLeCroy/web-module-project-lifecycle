# Github User Cards

This app uses Axios for GET requests 
As well as ChakraUI, and ReactIcons for styling

This app will retrieve a default user from the github api, and display their information, as well as their followers. Clicking on a follower will navigate you to a card of the clicked user.

You can also navigate backwards through the previous users with the arrow located to the left of the search bar
